This program allows you to set the brightness level of an HVAC system. It reads the input brightness level provided as a command-\/line argument and adjusts the system configuration accordingly. The program ensures that the minimum brightness level is 1 and the maximum brightness level is 254.\hypertarget{index_usage_sec}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Usage}{Usage}}\label{index_usage_sec}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Compile 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{g++\ HvAc\_Brightness.cpp\ -\/o\ setBrightness}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item Run the compiled executable. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./setBrightness\ 50\ }

\end{DoxyCode}
 To use this program, provide the desired brightness level as a command-\/line argument when executing the program. The program will then set the brightness level of the HVAC system accordingly.
