Digital Advertising & Analytics
We may partner with ad networks and other ad serving providers (“Advertising Providers”) that serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated platforms.  Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information Advertising Providers collect about your use of the Site and other sites or apps over time, including information about relationships among different browsers and devices.  This type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising.
You may visit the DAA Webchoices tool at www.aboutads.info to learn more about this type of advertising and how to opt out of this advertising on websites by companies participating in the DAA self-regulatory program.  If you delete your cookies or use a different browser or mobile device, you may need to renew your opt-out choices exercised through the DAA Webchoices tool.  Note that electing to opt out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications.  It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests.  
We may also work with third parties that collect data about your use of the Site and other sites or apps over time for non-advertising purposes.  Nuve uses Google Analytics and other third-party services to improve the performance of the Site and for analytics and marketing purposes.

Additionally, your browser may offer tools to limit the use of cookies or to delete cookies; however, if you use these tools, our Site may not function as intended.
Third-Party Links and Tools
The Site and App may provide links to third-party websites or apps.  We do not control the privacy practices of those websites or apps, and they are not covered by this privacy policy.  You should review the privacy policies of other websites or apps that you use to learn about their data practices.
